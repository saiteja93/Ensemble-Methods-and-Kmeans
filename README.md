The main aim of this assignment is to study the applications of basic Clustering Algorithms, namely, the K-Means algorithm and also to familiarize oneself with Matlab.

Task 1:
This tasks asks you implement the K-means algorithm from the scratch and uses the euclidean distance to compute the distance between any of the two points. We then had to find the SSE and report the optimal clustering among k = 3,5,7.

Task 2:
This task is the cummulative ensemble classification method, containing Neural Nets, SVM with a polynomial kernel of degree 2 and Feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer with 25 neurons. 
The task was to report the accuracies of the individual models on the test set. Also, report the accuracy of the entire ensemble on the test set, where the prediction of each sample is obtained by taking a majority vote on the predictions of the individual models.
